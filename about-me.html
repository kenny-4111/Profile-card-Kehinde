          into tech out of a strong desire to build beautiful, responsive, and
          scalable solutions that make a real world impact.

          Keep pushing forward, no matter how steep the learning curve gets.
          Remember that every late night debugging session and every small win
          adds up to something great. Your persistence will pay off, keep
          building!

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I enjoy chess, music, and deep conversations about
          purpose and growth. I believe true creativity is connecting logic with
          empathy and that’s exactly what I bring to every project I build.
