# Notes

## Testing Summary

1. **Timestamp (`Date.now`)**
   - Displays the current time in milliseconds.
   - Updates every second using `setInterval()`.
   - Verified accuracy by checking `Date.now()` value in console.

2. **Accessibility**
   - Avatar includes descriptive `alt` text.
   - All links are keyboard-focusable.
   - Social links open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Tested at different breakpoints:
   - Mobile: content stacks vertically.
   - Layout adjusts fluidly using Flexbox and media queries.

4. **Testing IDs**
   - Every visible element includes a `data-testid` attribute for automated tests:
     ```
     test-profile-card
     test-user-name
     test-user-bio
     test-user-avatar
     test-user-social-links
     test-user-hobbies
     test-user-dislikes
     test-user-time
     ```

## Additional Notes
- No external libraries or frameworks were used â€” only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Code follows semantic HTML standards (`article`, `section`, `nav`, `figure`).
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy live preview.
